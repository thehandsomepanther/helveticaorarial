# Helvetica or Arial
Font guessing game

A game inspired by Ironic Sans' <a href='http://www.ironicsans.com/helvarialquiz/'>Helvetica quiz</a>, Helvetica or Arial is a small game that tests a player's ability to distinguish between the two typefaces by generating a random statement in either Helvetica or Arial, then prompting the player to guess which font is being used. The game functions in its bare essentials, but updates and improvements are continually being made. 

I'll host it somewhere soon, but for now you can download the source files and play if you'd like. Contributions are welcome.
