# Helvetica or Arial
Font guessing game

Inspired by Ironic Sans' <a href='http://www.ironicsans.com/helvarialquiz/'>Helvetica quiz</a>, Helvetica or Arial is a small game that tests a player's ability to distinguish between the two typefaces by generating a random statement in either Helvetica or Arial, then prompting the player to guess which font is being used.
